# 👨‍💻 Julian Hecker — [@julian-hecker](https://github.com/julian-hecker/)
Good morning! I'm Julian, a developer and curious guy living in Raleigh, North Carolina.

- 📚 I've just finished up my BS degree of Computer Programming at Farmingdale State College. I'm also the founder of the Tech Club there.
- 💻 I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for LexisNexis in North Carolina, the Google of the legal world :)
- 🚧 [Barbago](https://github.com/julian-hecker/barbago) is my personal project, which I hope to make into a great startup!
